# Plan
# .rmd for sharing
# Box plot to explore
# ? Simple regression?
# What is goal? More people on food stamps. 
  # This could be more applications from likely converters. Could be outreach
      #...where to find appliers
  # ...or more conversions by changing some attribute that is changeable

#Effort could be applied where there are rejections. 

# Theories
  # Phone interviews will be less likely to be approved
  # Reminders are helpful
  # Will be significant skew in gender and age. 
  # Perhaps a low volume high-converting category will be one to targetn.
